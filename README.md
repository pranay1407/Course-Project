# Course-Project

#Prerequisites to understand this project:
-Strong knowledge of interface and polymorphism concept:
Interfaces: You should be familiar with the concept of interfaces in Java. An interface defines a contract for implementing classes, and understanding how to use interfaces is essential for this project.
Polymorphism: Understanding polymorphism and how it allows you to work with objects of different classes through a common interface is vital. You should know how to create and use references of the interface type to achieve polymorphism.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Understanding key OOP principles like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism is crucial. The project heavily relies on these concepts.

Compile and Run: Compile and run the Java application. The student can choose a course by entering the course number, and the program will display the course name and its purchase amount.
